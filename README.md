##Chinese-English Dictionary Tokenizer/Parser Program Golang

My very first own tokenizer/parser program writing in Go

As part of my learning process, I wanted to pursue the other art form of writing programs I have not done before.

All credits goes to online tutorials that taught me this far. 

I'm eager to learn more about them.

TODO:
1. Explore other ways to write tokenizer/parser program using Go libraries
2. Read file input stream of large dictionary translation data set
